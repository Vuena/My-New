            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-fintechBlack">The Compulsion Myth</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">Legally, the bank can request insurance when granting a loan, but cannot force you to buy it from *their* insurance company. They have to accept an equivalent policy you bring from outside.</p>

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-fintechBlack">Pledged Creditor (Dain-i Mürtehin)</h2>
            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">If you show the bank as the 'Pledged Creditor' in the insurance you take out, in case of death, the insurance first pays off the debt to the bank, and the remaining amount goes to your family.</p>
